    <h4>About the Department<h4>

<p>                                                                         The undergraduate course B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering was started in the year 1985 with a modest intake of 45 students. Over the years, the intake has increased from 45 to 120 and then 180. The post graduate course M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering specialization was started in the year 2006 with an intake of 18. The current intake for post graduate programme is 24. The Department has well qualified and experienced faculty and six of the 39 faculty members are Ph.D. degree holders with an average teaching experience of 15-20 years. The institute obtained autonomous status under VTU in the year 2015. The Department has autonomous batches in place across all the 4 years. The autonomous batch semester syllabus has been prepared with inputs from industry and academia in the Board of Studies meeting after a detailed discussion and deliberation. The primary objective of adopting a new syllabus is to make our students to be industry ready. We rigorously follow Outcome Based Education Teaching Learning paradigm to ensure improved quality teaching and learning to happen.
