It was affiliated to Karnatak University, Dharwad till 2002 & now it is  affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU ), Belgaum. The first batch of Mechanical Engineering  came out in 1984. Since then 28 batches have received their degrees. The department received VTU approval in 2003  for starting up of a new Research Center for catering to the growing needs of surrounding industries like foundries and hydro-pneumatic industries. The students can register here for Ph.D. and M.Sc. (Engg. by Research ) and pursue their research ambitions.
